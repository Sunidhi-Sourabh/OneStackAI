Below are **five privacy-first tools and services** that indie developers can mix-and-match to keep user data out of the hands of large analytics companies, ad networks, and data brokers.  Each entry explains *why* its privacy-first, *how* it works, and *why* an indie dev will want it.

| # | Tool | What it does | Privacy-first design | Why indie devs love it |
|---|------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Tauri** | Desktop application runtime (Windows/Mac/Linux) |  Built in Rust, no Node/Chromium runtime. <br> No telemetry, no external telemetry. <br> Uses native OS APIs for UI and filesystem access. |  Extremely small bundle size  ideal for indie launchers or lightweight utilities. <br> No heavy dependencies  you keep control of every line of code. <br> Same code-base works on all OSes, saving maintenance time. |
| 2 | **Supabase** (Self-hostable) | Open-source Firebase-compatible backend (Auth, DB, Storage, Functions) |  Can be run on your own VPS or cloud VM; you own the data. <br> No third-party tracking; all traffic stays on your network. <br> Transparent audit logs; everything is open source. |  Zero-cost starter plan and easy self-host option. <br> Works out-of-the-box with Postgres, Auth, REST/GraphQL APIs. <br> Gives you the power of a full-stack platform without the vendor lock-in. |
| 3 | **PostHog** (Self-hosted) | Analytics & feature-flag platform |  Stores event logs on your own servers. <br> No user-identifier or device ID sent to external services. <br> GDPR / CCPA-ready with anonymisation options built-in. |  Replace Google Analytics with a privacy-friendly alternative. <br> Feature-flag system lets you roll out UI changes safely. <br> Open source, so you can inspect the code youre shipping. |
| 4 | **Authelia** | Identity & access management (OAuth2/OpenID Connect, LDAP, 2FA) |  All authentication logic runs locally. <br> No external auth providers, no user-data leakage. <br> Encrypts secrets at rest and supports self-signed certificates. |  Ideal for self-hosted services, APIs, or admin dashboards. <br> Gives you granular control over user access without relying on AWS Cognito or Auth0. <br> Works seamlessly with Docker Compose or Kubernetes. |
| 5 | **Plausible Analytics** (Self-hosted) | Lightweight web analytics |  No cookies, no cross-site tracking. <br> Stores only event timestamps, page paths, and referrer (optional). <br> Open-source code, GDPR-ready out of the box. |  Great for small sites or product pages where you need basic metrics without intrusive scripts. <br> Small footprint (~20kB JavaScript)  fast load times for users on mobile or low-bandwidth connections. <br> Self-hosted version lets you keep all data in-house. |

### How to pick the right mix

| Use-case | Recommended tools |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Desktop app** | Tauri + Supabase for cloud sync (if you need user-data sync). |
| **Web app / SPA** | Supabase + Authelia + Plausible (or PostHog). |
| **API-driven backend** | Supabase (or plain Postgres) + Authelia + PostHog. |
| **Analytics-only** | Plausible (or PostHog)  no external data leakage. |
| **Self-hosted stack** | Docker-compose with all five above. |

**Tip:** Start with *Supabase* + *Plausible* if you want a minimal stack. As your product grows, add *Authelia* for auth and *PostHog* for more advanced analytics. All of these can run on a cheap VPS or a free tier on a cloud provider, keeping costs low for indie devs.

Happy building, and keep your users privacy front-and-center!
